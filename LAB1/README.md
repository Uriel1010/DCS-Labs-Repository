# LAB1 - Introduction, IDE Acquaintance

This folder contains the code files and resources for the LAB1 assignment of the DCS course. The LAB1 assignment focuses on introducing C/C++ for embedded programming, learning the CodeWarrior IDE (integrated development environment), and understanding the ARM Cortex Microcontroller structure and architecture.

## Files

- `func.c`: This file contains the implementation of various functions used in the LAB1 assignment, including functions for matrix operations, trace computation, diagonal comparison, matrix transpose, and more.
- `func.h`: This header file contains the function declarations and macros used in `func.c`.
- `HE1.pdf`: This PDF document provides additional information and instructions for the LAB1 assignment.
- `Home assignment - C language.pdf`: This PDF document contains the home assignment for the LAB1 assignment.
- `main.c`: This file contains the main program that interacts with the user and utilizes the functions defined in `func.c` to perform various operations on matrices.

Please refer to the individual files for more detailed information about the code implementation and functionality.

**Note:** This repository is an academic project and is intended for educational purposes only.

Feel free to explore the code and resources to understand the concepts and complete the LAB1 assignment successfully.
