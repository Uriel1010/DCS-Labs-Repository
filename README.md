# DCS Labs Repository

This repository contains the lab assignments and materials for the DCS (Digital Control Systems) course at Ben-Gurion University. Each lab folder corresponds to a specific lab session and includes the necessary code files, documentation, and supplementary materials.

## Labs Overview

* Lab 1 - Introduction, IDE acquaintance: Introduction to C/C++ for embedded programming, CodeWarrior IDE, and ARM Cortex Microcontroller structure and architecture.
* Lab 2 - GPIO: GPIO and Pin Multiplexing, Port control and interrupts, System Mode Controller.
* Lab 3 - Timers: Timer & PWM Module, Periodic Interrupt Timer, RTC & Low-Power Timer.
* Lab 4 - ADC & DAC: ADC & DAC peripheral Modules, Advanced ADC & DAC techniques.
* Lab 5 - DMA: Direct Memory Access Multiplexer, DMA Controller Module, Continuous or cycle-steal transfers.
* Lab 6 - UART, RS232: Asynchronous communication and Protocol, UART module, module interrupts, Serial communication DMA based.

## Lab Folder Structure
Each lab folder follows a similar structure, consisting of the following elements:

* **Preparation folder**: Contains pre-lab materials, including documentation, pre-lab reports, and code files for preparation tasks.
* **Realtime folder**: Contains real-time lab materials, including the final lab reports, code files, and additional resources.
* **CW folder** (if applicable): Contains CodeWarrior IDE specific files, such as project headers and source files.
Please refer to the individual lab folders for more detailed information and specific file contents.
